        <p>HTML and CSS are both languages, HTML controls the structure of a web
          page, CSS controls the style of a page (how it looks).<span>
          DOM (Document Object Model) is the tree like structure of a page, it
          is a way of representing the hierarchical nature of a struture in a
          graphical form.</span>
          Java Script is the interactive component, everything needs to be
          attached and we need tools for developing a website.</p>

          </font><strong>
            <p>All elements of a structure of a page are <b>rectangular</b> and
              I can have the same text on the structure as the one that appears
              on the page.

            </font><strong>
              <p>Google Chrome developer tools is found by clicking on settings
                on the top right corner of any web page, followed by "more tools"
                and "developer tools".<span>
                The page will then split in two, either vertically or horizontally.
                One half is the opened web page and the other half is where you
                can inspect elements of the codes used for that page and you can
                play around with the tools available.</span>
                When you hover around the code, chrome tells you where the table
                content is by highlighting it in blue on the page. Or you can know
                where certain code is referring to by right clicking on the part
                of the website you want to inspect and selecting "inspect". It
                will take directly to the part of the code that belongs to the
                highlighted area on the website.<br>
                Another option is right clicking on a code and select "scroll to
                view", it should take you to the exact part of the website that
                the code refers to.<br>
                Developer tool is an interactive road map that shows where elements
                and codes falls in line with each other.<br>
                Another part of the developer tools is under the "style" section
                which is very useful for knowing the size of an element or content
                by just looking at the box displayed on the far right.<br>
                You can change the size of a box by changing the numbers in the box.
                To change a colour, under "style" tool, click near the { symbol and
                type "background". Choose "background-colour" from the menu that will
                come up, then click enter. Hit the tab button and another menu will
                come up with a list of colours. You can scroll down all colours by
                clicking on Shift + down arrow.<br>
                To change fontes, sizes or colours on the actual website, right
                click on the part of the code you want to change and select "edit
                attribute". That is a great way of playing around with websites and
                finding your way around the codes.<br>
                Note that these changes will not effectively change the website,
                only you will be able to see these changes and once you refresh or
                close the browser, it will go back to normal on your screen.
                Developers explore other websites elements, inspect and dynamically
                change styles and that is a great way of understanding the relationship
                between DOM and CSS.<br>
                Once inspecting elements of a page, you will find many little arrows.
                These little arrows expand the tree and reveal hidden parts of the
                code.

              </font><strong>
                <p>Sideways arrows are an HTML element, each has an opening and
                  closing tag. It can be a text or another element, for example:
                  &lt;span&gt; or &lt;a&gt;
                </p>
                <!--when inspecting elements it is important to click on the sideways
                arrows in order to expand all elements-->

              <p>As a Front End Developer I need to turn images and PDF files into
                a website with all necessary components, HTML files, CSS files and
                Java Script files. For that we need to know the conceptual
                understanding of the way website works.<br>
                Full explanation as to the concept of how the web works can be
                found on following <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/How_the_Web_works">link</a>

                    <strong><h3><font face="verdana">How the browser knows what style
                      to apply and where that style comes from</h3><strong>
                        <p>HTML is the language of the web and it has specific sintax
                          and rules, you write HTML in a document following HTML
                          sintax and rules.<br>
                          The basic word for HTML is tag. The browser turns HTML
                          tags into elements that form a tree. It knows how to do
                          that because of the Document Object Model (DOM) which is
                          a standard convention for representing and interacting
                          with elements in HTML.<br>
                          The tree in a development tool is a DOM tree that the browser
                          built from an HTML document. Each HTML tag creates an element
                          in the DOM that the browser uses to display the page.<br>
                          An element is created from the starting tag to the ending tag
                          and everything in between is content. Example: (opening tag)
                          &lt;tag&gt; content &lt;/tag&gt; (closing tag).<br>
                          The "content" can be empty, can be text or it can be another
                          element. Each tag has a name or type that defines what kind of
                          element will be created i.e. element can be paragraph, an image
                          or just a document division.<br>
                          <b>Block -</b> Each tag can also have attributes with values
                          i.e. &lt;h1 class="article"&gt; where "class" is the attribute and
                          "article" is the value of the attribute.<br>
                          The document written in HTML defines the structure and content
                          of the page. To define the style we use CSS.<br>
                          CSS allow you to use specific sintax and rules to change how the
                          elements look on the page, the size of the font, colour,
                          background, borders, position and so on. For example, CSS can be used
                          to say that all h1 elements that belongs to class article should have
                          the text colour green &lt;h1 class="article"&gt;<br>
                          To tie style and structure together, the HTML document can provide
                          the browser with information on what style to use and where to get it.

                          <p>Any shape (circle, triangule...) becomes a square when "boder radius"
                            is unchecked. Everything turns into a box and it is very important to
                            think everything is terms of boxes when developing a web page.<br>
                            A good way to visualise and organise your website is by drawing all the
                            boxes necessary to the page on a piece of paper, starting from the
                            bigger boxes to the smaller ones. <!--this is from Lesson 2.14-->
                            <!--The border-radius CSS property lets you round the corners of an
                            element's outer border edge. You can specify a single radius to make circular

                            <p>A good way of translating a web page in HTML is by dividing and finding all
                              the boxes in the page. All boxes are defined with "div" tags.<br>
                              To apply style, size, location... we need to give each element a class attribute.
                              "Class attributes" are like label on boxes, somenthing to remind you what is
                              inside the box.
